# Karim Nasreddine Portfolio

This is a portfolio website showcasing my skills and projects. The website is built with React, Bootstrap, and react-spring for animations.

## Description

The portfolio website includes an "About Me" section, a "Portfolio" section that showcases my projects, a "Contact" section with my contact information, and a "Resume" section where visitors can download my resume. The design is minimalistic and professional, using a black-and-white color scheme.
