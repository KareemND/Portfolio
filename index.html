    <h2> About Me </h2>
    <p>I am a person who values life and appreciate all the opportunites that it presents me. That is why I tend to be
      driven to take those opportunities and push myself to grasp the most out of them. I am also passionate about many
      topics such as, but not limited to, sports and technology. I grew up and was fascinated in soccer and gaming. My
      interest in gaming sparked a huge interest in technology and computing, which made me want to learn more about
      computers and how they work. </p>
