      <h2>About Myself</h2>
      <div>
        <p>
          I am a person who values life and appreciate all the opportunites that it presents me. That is why I tend to be driven to take those opportunities and push myself to grasp the most out of them. I am also passionate about many topics such as, but not limited to, sports and technology. I grew up and was fascinated in soccer and gaming. My interest in gaming sparked a huge interest in technology and computing, which made me want to learn more about computers and how they work.
